# chatbot
This is a simple Chatbot application.
Inorder to run this just copy the code and the nlp.txt file in the same path.
Then open jupyter notebook then it will run fine.
Note if you dont add the txt file in the same path then you have to make changes in the "f=open('nlp.txt','r',errors = 'ignore')" this line of the code
Here instead of directly typing nlp.txt you have to all the whole path of the txt file where you added in your computer.
